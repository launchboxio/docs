# Welcome to Launchbox!

We're glad you're here! 

## What we do

In recent years, applications have grown increasingly complex
- OAuth / OIDC integrations 
- Webhooks and Callbacks 
- Cloud Provider IAM configurations 
- and on, and on

Launchbox was built to solve these problems for engineers, product teams, and support staff alike. In Launchbox parlance,
we deal with "Projects". For every project that gets created, we quickly spin up an ephemeral cluster (powered by VCluster). 
Addons and services can then either be installed through your traditional tooling, or through one of our automation mechanisms.

## Open Source, Always 

Our ethos can be stated simply in those 3 words. We strive to keep all of our components and libraries MIT licensed, and 
available to the public. No gotchas, no strings attached. 

There's some things we can't share, such as internal infrastructure 
configuration and the like. You'll have to get hired to access those :wink:

With that in mind, here's a few related stances on business:

- We don't do enterprise licensing. At all.
- We don't put any of our features behind a paywall. 
- We don't require any licensing to self-host the fully featured platform.

Our public SaaS platform allows engineers, teams, and organizations to leverage our distributed network of clusters. We 
provide these environments at extremely competitive pricing, and handle all of the Day 2 operations required. However, 
if you want to self-host the platform, we support and encourage that. And you won't have to pay us anything. We do have 
contracts available for white glove installations, or for ongoing support, but none of that is required. You can deploy 
the platform, kick the tires on every single feature, and use it for years before wanting a support contract. If ever

For the folks who would like to host Launchbox internally, you can get started [here](#open-source-always-)
